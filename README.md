Happy Trak: This app aims to asses employee satisfaction, engament and well-being by collecting data on various aspects of the work environment. This is done by giving surveys every week and track this data. 

This app is created with the employees in mind. Surveys are sent every week for employees to respond and submit and therefore, gauge their satisfaction accross multiple aspects of their work envrionment. This helps the employer track happinees in the workplace and it may provide valuable feedback to organizations, which may help them identify areas of improvement, implement changes, and create a more positive and supportive work envrionmentfor their employees.  

Technology used for this app includes, React, React Router, Hooks, node,js, postgreSQL, and mongodb. 

React was used in this project to build reusable UI components. Which allowed us to create a dynamic and interactive user interface by composing components, managing state and props, and efficiently updating the DOM. React, provides a virtual DOM, which optimizes performance by minimizing actual DOM updates, which result in a faster rendering and better user experience. 

React Router handled client side routing. Also react router prevents triggering a full page reload. It allowed for define routes routes for different paths in this React application.    

Hooks are a new feature introduced in React 16.8. This new featured allowed us to use state and create functional components. Hooks provided an alternative to manage state, use UseState, useEffect which managed component state, and handling side-effect and therefore, mades our code more modular.

Node.js was used in order to use javascript in the backend. It was used in the server so we could use javascript in the front end and back end and therefore be string line. Node.js provided a path to install and create a dependency file that future developers can utilize to start working in the project immediately. 

PostgreSQL was used for our data storage and management. It provided a realiable and efficient way to store and manage structured data. 

MongoDB was used to store user information such as name and password. MongoDB was used to create user authentication and session control. Mongoose was used as a tool framework to make changes to the database as needed.
